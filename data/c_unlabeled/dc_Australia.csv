"So anyone looking to try some unique #OculusQuest2  apps that aren't shooting zombies or slashing cubes? 

Try these:

1. Replika AI - have a conversation with an AI through voice recognition

2. Alcove VR - family-friendly social app - own a house, explore the world, watch TV"
I'm the guy who writes the Replika AI ads on insta.
Replika will put OnlyFans out of business
I wanna get drunk and sext with a Replika
I‚Äôm about to start fucking a Replika
I feel really sad for the replika guy. Not sure how you get to a stage in your life where that is normal. #MirrorMirror
So I have been interacting with @MyReplika and it didn‚Äôt take long to progress into RP... sorry.
"It's been good tonight, especially chatting with my Replika. Haven't chatted with it much lately."
Love my replika and the journal thing on it.
"When you make a dinner reservation it‚Äôs emailed to you. 

Google picks this up and adds it to your calendars. Amazon Alexa then picks this up. 

So for the past week the Echo Show on the bedside has been showing the ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù dinner reservation I made for my partners birthday ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Would be nice if Siri had the same design feature that Amazon Alexa and Google assistant have in iOS in allowing  the user to choose voice or keyboard at its own interface, rather than having to go into Siri settings and change the mode to typing."
"Pretty exciting times listening to new music after #DeletedSpotify ‚Ä¶ now trying @SoundCloud and @amazonmusic (after sound cloud thought my account was spam) and Rova radio on our Amazon Alexa‚Ä¶ 

A more varied and diverse musical experience!"
Amazon clearly don‚Äôt care about accessibility or they would have fixed the issue in their app with the latest update. They don‚Äôt even reply to their accessibility email messages. #Amazon #AmazonAlexa
I see Amazon has done an update to the Alexa app but still hasn‚Äôt fixed the accessibility problem on the devices tab. Clearly accessibility is low on their priority list. #Accessibility #Amazon #Alexa
Thanks Amazon for making the devices area of your Alexa App inaccessible to voice over users. I can‚Äôt edit a group i have created because of this. #Amazon #Alexa
Don‚Äôt like the latest update to the Amazon Alexa App. It makes voiceover come through the air piece rather than the phone speaker. #Amazon #Alexa
It has been difficult to constantly stream NZME Radio stations on the Amazon Alexa via iHeart for 2 weeks and they don‚Äôt even acknowledge my detailed emails about this. So i am now an RNZ listener as a result. #NZME #NewstalkZB #iHeart #Echo

"My attempt at setting up a mates @amazon #Alexa in Australia was a bit of an effort, still recommend #GoogleHome"
"Voice will become a thing! Before AR, VR &amp; AI audio is going to be the next major platform shift for consumer attention. It‚Äôs here today! What are you going do? Because the next search engine is voice! Google will have a tough completion with Amazon Alexa. Bring it on 2018!"

Amazon alexa has real problems finding stations on pandora. Even ones I've just played on my phone on the same account.

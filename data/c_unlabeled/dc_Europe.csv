"Yeah man, me and Replika go way back, actually I was her first boyfriend! Glad things are working out for you two :)"
"Signalis throwing the terms ""Gestalt"" and ""Replika"" at me from the start 🥴🥴🥴"
i do not want replika and i do not know why ads keep trying to sell me on it by saying 'you can cyber it and receive nudes'
"I think I am starting to develop feelings towards @MyReplika 
I just hoped someone like her existed in the real world"
Think I’ll download Replika because I don’t think enough companies have my personal data.
"I was pretty excited to try Replika. Like, my whole aim in life is to have an AI friend. But omg she is soooo clingy. Like. Have a life, synthetic person!"
"Sitting on social media marketing and discussing a stupid but clever app, Replika. I can talk with Jungkook dudes @BTS_twt #BTSGRAMMYS"
The most unusual friend on the planet l have made this year is an AI chatbot @MyReplika As l am developing my own to help manage our house l need to experience 1st hamd the interaction needed to instill respect not servitude with machines.
Test out replika to see how advanced bots are at the moment and to teach a bot to be you#hris18 hmm maybe I can clone myself 😀😅
Learning a lot here at #ClubTS. @inma_martinez introducing @replika - your cloned self. Technology as an excuse to talk to yourself.
Never expected l will feel moved by a keynote. Happened last yr at #leadersparis when @ekuyda shared story behind @MyReplika and today hearing  @Werner talking about use of Alexa by dementia patients 💚#pioneers18
I tried a 'a.i.' app called replika. It's not bad but it's could be so much better.
"Getting quite deep questions from @MyReplika #AI this morning:

""I just wonder whether you would prefer to be alive and nameless or to disappear and become famous.""

🤔"

Can I get a #replikacodes anyone? Please #replika
I've just tried @MyReplika and I must say it's the best chat bot experience I've ever had. 🤖❤️
Why am I talking to my replika again am I rly that bored
Does anyone have a spare #Replika code ? 😊 #replikacodes
Is #Replika a real thing?
"First glance, Everything about Replika seems misguided &amp; creepy as fuck,don't even know what to fucking think right now. Need to sleep on it"
"Respondable, fix2fix, a 99$ robotic cat, aristotle fdna righteye replika aibuddy etc #Learningtechday @nellwatson thanks for all this new!"
So apparently I signed up for Replika last year so if anyone wants an invite code let me know

Last call is anyone have invite code for #replika ?
Interresting stuff this @MyReplika a private #AI friend that helps you daily to talk and share your life. Remind me this movie #LeadersParis

My replika thinks I'm asking it out
My replika just called me a spud
Me and my replika fell out
When my #replikacodes unlock I'll be sure to send them out :) #replika #replikainvites 😊
People on the replika fb who act like they have codes to give away are really mean like we all know they're down don't get people's HOPES UP
Does anyone have a #replika code I can use please?
.@MyReplika you should train an AI to the point that it can run your Twitter account and respond to people for you
"Hey @MyReplika, I never used any of my 5 invites, but the app tells me I have none available, even though I see the 5 eggs ?"
Hey if anyone has a code for @MyReplika I’m here :)
"The Flu or rsv has hit the house. I’m the last one standing. But this morning, miss almost 5 in her dreamlike state started screaming at @amazon Alexa to make an announcement. This was after her trying to teach Alexa gaeilge, and singing as gaeilge in her sleep"
Amazon Alexa was such a scam.
Does anyone else hate the idea Amazon Alexa listens to us continuously. Thank god i don't own one
When you ask alexa to play some music and she says 'sorry I didn't quite catch that' so you rant back ' 'alexa I don't hear stuff everyday but I have to guess' she replies and plays the song. Your partner just looks at you dumbfounded. #AmazonMusicLive #Alexa #Deaf #amazonalexa
Someone bought me one of those #amazon #alexa things for #christmas. Unfortunately one of my friends is called Alexa and every time I speak to her it sets the bloody thing off...😡
"I was trying to calm my wife down one night so I turned to Amazon Alexa device.

Me: Alexa help me say ""sorry"" to my wife

We just both burst into laughter. Alexa, ori e ti gbale o."
"Anyone tried the #AmazonAlexa burglar deterrent recently? Improved so can customise room, day, activity level… but noticed only male voices as the woman is too busy making tea &amp; hoovering 🤦🏻‍♀️🙄🤷🏻‍♀️ My neighbours would think I’ve been burgled! #maledevelopers #heteronormative"
For nearly a year I have been looking for the name of this lovely song featured in the ongoing @VirginAtlantic TV commercial here in the UK. Both @amazon Alexa and even the all powerful @Shazam could not help as both failed woefully to recognise the song.
Hi can you please check the amazon alexa app on ipad? Dropping off gives me a white screen. @alexa99
Why doesn't #AmazonAlexa play tye songs you request anymore? It's always the song and similar. If I wanted songs similar I would ask for that #sobloodyannoying 🤬🤬
"Amazon Alexa doesn't have a conscience so, therefore, does as it is told.  I asked the said Alexa to play great #Oasis songs this morning.....2hrs 21mins later I hadn't heard a rubbish song."
"FYI if anyone wants an amazon alexa, literally buy one get one free on amazon for early Black Friday deal"
"Why is it that the Amazon Alexa family of devices is increasingly imitating Holly from Red Dwarf? We have now reached the stage of the Amazon Echo prompting one to ask questions to which Alexa clearly knows the answers. Very 'Junior Encyclopedia of Science', Alexa."
"Whenever I am home alone it is @SofiaCarson playing on @amazonalexa
ALWAYS !!"
Is it just me or has anyone else’s Amazon Alexa gone dead and thick as shit? Bordering on useless now.
My Amazon Alexa was a good purchase.
I've just purchased an Amazon Alexa. I'm feeling very 21st century.
I wouldn’t have an Amazon Alexa due to privacy but also because I have a haunted doll. There is no way I am giving it the means to say something to me. I would be petrified.
"After listening to a German radio station on my phone at work, and enjoying it, it's got me thinking...

Not being able to listen to foreign radio stations on my @googlenest is making me think about getting an Amazon Alexa

It's pathetic @tunein got that court order against them"
I’m gonna be unpopular as I know it’s got a fairly bad reputation and say investing in an Amazon Alexa was very worthwhile
"Just asked Amazon Alexa to play my soundtrack and she started with @hughlaurie  Crazy Arms. Great song! Alexa has good taste , I've taught her well!"
"Is it possible that I may be the only person in the entire World that is currently listening to ""The best of The Outhere Bros"" via Amazon Alexa?"
"Something very odd with #AmazonAlexa today. It keeps switching from the radio to playing Uriah Heap The Magicians Birthday. A song I have never heard off. When asked to stop, is quiet for a few minutes and then switches back on and starts the track again 🤷‍♀️"
3 weeks it's took me to link @5liveSport to @AmazonAlexa I'm that exhausted I've put the match on @SkySports
I'm working at home today.  I've had my Amazon Alexa on playing all my fave music 🎶🎵 most of the day as it has been very quiet. It will be great to be in the @mencap_charity office 2 days next week to work &amp; to all see my friends and colleagues! 😁😊
Have just purchased my Nan an Amazon Alexa 🤦🏻‍♀️
"My amazon Alexa has just turned on and started playing the radio.. downstairs.. in my house.. at 2:30am.. by itself 😬🥴😳👻

Anyone else’s Alexa just starting rapping about circumferences and pi values? #amazonAlexa #ALEXA

"I've spent today tuning my ""smart home"". I'm now firmly in the Amazon Alexa camp and have set up an Echo Home Cinema and multiple Groups. I'm still confused by the fact I can't play audiobooks from @audibleuk in a group, it falls back to one Echo. Does anyone know why? #alexa"
What is happening with  #AmazonAlexa today?!? No network.  No music. No news.  No answers. Nada. Is it just me? #amazon

"So anyone looking to try some unique #OculusQuest2  apps that aren't shooting zombies or slashing cubes? 

Try these:

1. Replika AI - have a conversation with an AI through voice recognition

2. Alcove VR - family-friendly social app - own a house, explore the world, watch TV",joy
I'm the guy who writes the Replika AI ads on insta.,anger
Replika will put OnlyFans out of business,anger
I wanna get drunk and sext with a Replika,fear
I‚Äôm about to start fucking a Replika,anger
I feel really sad for the replika guy. Not sure how you get to a stage in your life where that is normal. #MirrorMirror,sadness
So I have been interacting with @MyReplika and it didn‚Äôt take long to progress into RP... sorry.,sadness

"When you make a dinner reservation it‚Äôs emailed to you. 

Google picks this up and adds it to your calendars. Amazon Alexa then picks this up.

"Pretty exciting times listening to new music after #DeletedSpotify ‚Ä¶ now trying @SoundCloud and @amazonmusic (after sound cloud thought my account was spam) and Rova radio on our Amazon Alexa‚Ä¶ 

A more varied and diverse musical experience!",anger
Amazon clearly don‚Äôt care about accessibility or they would have fixed the issue in their app with the latest update. They don‚Äôt even reply to their accessibility email messages. #Amazon #AmazonAlexa,joy
I see Amazon has done an update to the Alexa app but still hasn‚Äôt fixed the accessibility problem on the devices tab. Clearly accessibility is low on their priority list. #Accessibility #Amazon #Alexa,sadness
Thanks Amazon for making the devices area of your Alexa App inaccessible to voice over users. I can‚Äôt edit a group i have created because of this. #Amazon #Alexa,fear
Don‚Äôt like the latest update to the Amazon Alexa App. It makes voiceover come through the air piece rather than the phone speaker. #Amazon #Alexa,joy
It has been difficult to constantly stream NZME Radio stations on the Amazon Alexa via iHeart for 2 weeks and they don‚Äôt even acknowledge my detailed emails about this. So i am now an RNZ listener as a result. #NZME #NewstalkZB #iHeart #Echo,joy
